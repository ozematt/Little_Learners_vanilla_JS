# 🧒 Little Learners 🎒

**Little Learners** is a responsive, multi-page website built with plain TypeScript (Vanilla JS) and styled using Sass. The project is based on a [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/mhDBCW795qtJ5e8sAwseLA/School-Education-Website-UI-Template---Light-Theme--Neubrutalism----FREE-Editable--Community-?node-id=164-34417&t=ZzSGOjTN7nlbGYrM-0) and was intentionally developed without frameworks to refresh and strengthen my understanding of core JavaScript concepts.

The code is modular and maintainable, with encapsulated logic written using classes. Sass was used to organize styles into reusable, scalable components. The website includes sections such as About, Offer, and Contact, as well as a validated contact form and a mobile-first layout.
